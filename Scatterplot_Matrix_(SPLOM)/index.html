        <h2>Task 1c (5 points)</h2>
        <i>Using the visualization you created, list a number of findings about the datasets: <br>
            - Which ones are the correlated dimensions? <br>
            - What elements in the visualizations can help you identify the correlated dimensions?  <br>
            - What can you say about the data, based on the correlations? </i>
    <p>
        The most positively correlated dimensions are highway_mpg and city_mpg, price and engine_size, horsepower and engine_size, and horsepower and price.
        The most inversely correlated dimensions are city_mpg and horsepower, highway_mpg and horsepower, and highway_mpg and price.<br><br>

        The first thing that comes at sight is the points in the scatterplot of highway_mpg and city_mpg since its points are the most compacted in a ascendent line. In second term some other correlations can be seen in the plots, 
        but the numbers in the correlations are most helpful to detect which of these are the strongest. <br><br>

        The observed correlations seem plausible since it is expected that the consumption of gas is similar in cities and highways. Moreover,
        the price correlations also are according to expected: the greater the engine and horsepower the more costy the car is.
        Regarding the inverse correlations it is apparently the case that greater horsepower takes to less gas consumption.<br><br>

        Finally, attending to the low correlations, it seems that the cars rpm does not have a strong relation with any of the assessed variables.

        <h2>Task 2 (5 points)</h2>
        <i>Which visualization would you choose to create?<br>
        Describe the visualization inlcuding visual encodings and justify your answer.  </i>
        <p>
        <!-- The visualisation should serve to identify patterns in the user characteristic that can be used to create differential marketing
            campaigns for diverse user groups. Thus, it is necessary to
        
            1. get an understanding of the individual variables (e.g. if most users are of a certain age group)
            2. patterns in the data (e.g. between age group and user satisfaction) </p>
        -->
        <p>
            Assuming the dataset is large in the number of data points but not dimension, a scatterplot matrix would be the most fitting method for inspection.
            It grants insights on both the individual variables, as well as pairwise relationships. A scatterplot matrix with scatterplots, histograms and correlation metrices, just as in task 1 would be fitting.
            Clusters in the scatterplot matrix should be encoded by color with a color blind friendly palette to ease investigation. This visualisation would use position (points in plots), color (clusters), and texture (cells).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Scatterplot matrices have a disadvantage in displaying a lot of information at once. Thus, it is necessary to highlight relevant cells in the matrix to guide the attention of the client.
            After investigation, variables with relevant relationships should be placed close to each other to be easier to find for the client. More relevant individual variables should be placed closer to the top left.
            The most relevant cells should be highlighted by a thicker outline (texture) that is blue rather than black (color)
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Parallel coordinate plots are probably hard to grasp for non-expert users, and mosaic plots are better suited when checking for more than pairwise relationships. Crosstabular visualisations would also be well-suited for easy understanding and to avoid overplotting,
            but may not reveal the desired patterns as well as a scatterplot matrix.
